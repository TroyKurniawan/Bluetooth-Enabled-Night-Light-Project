# Bluetooth-Enabled Night Light Project

The "Bluetooth-Enabled Night Light" project was a student project completed for an “Electronics” class. The device served as a typical night light that can only be powered on through a bluetooth connection to a phone application. When the device is initially turned on, the device makes a beeping sound to notify its status. From there, the device is able to detect light. When the sensor is not exposed to light, an LED turns on (and vice versa).
